    - `Darwin`

**Prerequisites**
---
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) (optional dependency used to show icons)

**Recommended Settings**
---
```lua
vim.o.updatetime = 300
vim.o.incsearch = false
vim.wo.signcolumn = 'yes'
```

**Installation**
---
Default installation via Packer.
```lua
use {
  'tanvirtin/vgit.nvim',
  requires = {
    'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim'
  }
}
```

**Setup**
---
You must instantiate the plugin in order for the features to work.
```lua
require('vgit').setup()
```

To embed the above code snippet in a .vim file wrap it in lua << EOF code-snippet EOF.
```lua
lua << EOF
require('vgit').setup()
EOF
```

Highlights, signs, keymappings are few examples of what can be configured in VGit. Advanced setup below shows you all configurable parameters in VGit.

| Function Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| setup | Sets VGit up for you. This plugin cannot be used before this function has been called. |
| buffer_hunk_preview | Opens a diff preview showing the diff of the current buffer in comparison to that found in index. This preview will open up in a smaller window relative to where your cursor is. |
| buffer_diff_preview | Opens a diff preview showing the diff of the current buffer in comparison to that found in index. If the command is called while being on a hunk, the window will open focused on the diff of that hunk. |
| buffer_history_preview | Opens a diff preview along with a table of logs, enabling users to see different iterations of the file through it's lifecycle in git. |
| buffer_blame_preview | Opens a preview detailing the blame of the line that based on the cursor position within the buffer. |
| buffer_gutter_blame_preview | Opens a preview which shows all the blames related to the lines of the buffer. |
| buffer_diff_staged_preview | Opens a diff preview showing the diff of the staged changes in the current buffer. |
| buffer_hunk_staged_preview | Opens a diff preview showing the diff of the staged changes in the current buffer. This preview will open up in a smaller window relative to where your cursor is. |
| project_diff_preview | Opens a diff preview along with a table of all the files that have been changed, enabling users to see all the files that were changed in the current project. This preview supports the following commands, "buffer_stage", "buffer_unstage", "buffer_reset", "stage_all" and "unstage_all". |
| project_hunks_preview | Opens a diff preview along with a table of all the current hunks in the project. Users can use this preview to cycle through all the hunks. |
| project_hunks_qf | Populate the quickfix list with hunks. Automatically opens the quickfix window. |
| buffer_hunk_stage | Stages a hunk, if a cursor is on the hunk. |
| buffer_hunk_reset | Removes all changes made in the buffer on the hunk the cursor is currently on to what exists in HEAD. |
| buffer_stage | Stages all changes in the current buffer. |
| buffer_unstage | Unstages all changes in the current buffer. |
| buffer_reset | Removes all current changes in the buffer and resets it to the version in HEAD. |
| stage_all | Stages all file changes in your project. |
| unstage_all | Unstages all file changes in your project. |
| reset_all | Discards all file changes that are not staged. |
| hunk_up | Moves the cursor to the hunk above the current cursor position. |
| hunk_down | Moves the cursor to the hunk below the current cursor position. |
| toggle_diff_preference | Used to switch between "split" and "unified" diff. |
| toggle_live_gutter | Enables/disables git gutter signs. |
| toggle_live_blame | Used to switch between "split" and "unified" diff. |
| toggle_authorship_code_lens | Enables/disables authorship code lens that can be found on top of the file |
| enable_tracing | Enables debug logs that are used internally by VGit to make suppressed logs visible. |
| disable_tracing | Disables debug logs that are used internally by VGit to make suppressed logs visible. |
